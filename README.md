# Color Wheel and Displacement Visualization

This Python code provides a visualization of a color wheel and displacement vectors using matplotlib. The color wheel is generated using a custom color mapping function that creates a smooth gradient of colors. The displacement vectors are plotted as arrows on a grid, with the color of each arrow corresponding to the color from the color wheel based on its location. This code can be used to visually represent optical flow or any other displacement-related data in a clear and intuitive manner. It is useful for computer vision, image processing, and graphics applications.

##Getting Started
###Prerequisites
This code has been written in Python 3. You'll need the following packages installed to run this code:

- numpy
- matplotlib

### Installation
You can install numpy and matplotlib packages using the following commands:
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

## Usage

To use the financial calculator program, run the `financial_calculator.py` file on your local machine. The program will prompt you to choose either the investment calculator or the home loan repayment calculator.

### Investment Calculator

If you choose the investment calculator, the program will ask you to input the following values:

- Deposit amount
- Interest rate (only the number of the interest without percentage)
- Number of investing years
- Type of interest calculation (simple or compound)

The program will then calculate the total amount of interest you'll earn on your investment based on the input values and output the result.

### Home Loan Repayment Calculator

If you choose the home loan repayment calculator, the program will ask you to input the following values:

- Present value of the house
- Interest rate (only the number of the interest without percentage)
- Number of months you plan to take to repay the bond

The program will then calculate the amount you'll have to pay on your home loan each month based on the input values and output the result.
