# Color Wheel and Displacement Visualization
Description: This Python code provides a visualization of a color wheel and displacement vectors using matplotlib.
The color wheel is generated using a custom color mapping function that creates a smooth gradient of colors.
The displacement vectors are plotted as arrows on a grid, with the color of each arrow corresponding to the color
from the color wheel based on its location. This code can be used to visually represent optical flow or any other
displacement-related data in a clear and intuitive manner. It is useful for computer vision, image processing,
and graphics applications. You are free to use and modify this code in your own projects with proper attribution.
Happy coding!
